Explained how input and output can be taken and displayed respectively using GUI

**GUI_Practice.py:**

- I have used simpledialog for taking GUI based input name from user
  
- I have printed that input in console
  
- Afterwards, I displayed a GUI based output "Hello, Welcome!" using messagebox


**input_output_Exercise.py:**

- I have solved various tasks with the same concept of simpledialog and messagebox.! Following were the tasks

  **_Task 1:_**  Ask an input from the user and display that input using GUI

  **_Task 2:_** Ask a list of integers from the user in a single input using “+” symbol as a separator

  **_Task 3:_** Display table of a number input from user (GUI based)


**greatest_among_five.py**

- Entered a list of integers separated by space using GUI by simpledialog

- Prints the list in the console

- using loop, found the maximum number among the list (Can be found using built-in max function as well)

- displayed the maximum number using GUI by messagebox
